# Comprehensive-Risk-Modeling-Value-at-Risk-VaR-Expected-Shortfall-and-Model-Backtesting

Developed and implemented Value at Risk (VaR) models using Historical Simulation, VarianceCovariance, and Monte Carlo Simulation methods, leveraging pandas, numpy & scipy for quantitative computations.
Analyzed portfolio risk exposure and tested the VaR model in different market conditions.

Conducted rigorous backtesting of VaR models using Traffic Light and Kupiec Tests to assess the
accuracy and reliability of risk predictions. Designed statistical validation techniques to ensure model
robustness and compliance with regulatory frameworks such as Basel III.

Implemented Expected Shortfall (Conditional VaR) as an advanced risk measure, comparing its
effectiveness against traditional VaR models. Conducted analysis to evaluate risk under tail events,
improving risk management strategies and decision-making processes.
